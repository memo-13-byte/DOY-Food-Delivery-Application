can u give me restaurant owner version of this for food delivery web page


Certainly! I'll adapt the use case you provided for a restaurant owner using a food delivery web page. The structure will remain similar, but the details will be tailored to the context of a restaurant owner managing orders on a food delivery platform. Here's the restaurant owner version:

Use Case Number: 020

Use Case Code: UC-FD-020

Use Case Name: Restaurant Owner Login

Decipter: Ashi T.

Description Date: 14/03/2025

Last Modification: [To be updated]

Last Modification Date: [To be updated]

Actor(s): Restaurant Owner

Short Definition: Restaurant owners log into the food delivery web page using their credentials.

Pre-condition: Restaurant owner must have valid login credentials (username/email and password).

Post-condition: Restaurant owner successfully logs in and can manage orders, update menus, and view delivery statuses.

Priority: High

Frequency of Occurrence: High, especially during peak business hours (e.g., lunch and dinner times).

Main Path:

Restaurant owner enters login ID (username or email) and password.
System authenticates the credentials.
Restaurant owner is granted access to the restaurant management dashboard.
Alternative Path:

A.01: If login fails (incorrect credentials), the system prompts the restaurant owner to re-enter login details or reset their password.

Containing Use-Case(s):
Special Requirements:

The system must ensure login security (e.g., CAPTCHA, two-factor authentication, or password encryption).
The platform should support multi-language options for restaurant owners in diverse regions.
Assumptions:

Restaurant owner has an internet connection.
The restaurant is registered on the food delivery platform.
Note:

The system should provide an option for password recovery in case the restaurant owner forgets their credentials.
Explanation of Changes:
Actor: Changed from "Courier" to "Restaurant Owner" to reflect the new user.
Use Case Details: Adjusted the use case number, code, and name to fit the food delivery context (e.g., "UC-FD-020" for food delivery).
Short Definition and Conditions: Updated to focus on the restaurant owner logging in to manage their restaurant's operations on the platform.
Main Path: Kept the login process similar but specified the outcome as accessing a "restaurant management dashboard" instead of a "delivery dashboard."
Alternative Path: Kept the same logic for failed logins but rephrased for the restaurant owner.
Special Requirements: Added a multi-language support requirement, as restaurant owners may operate in diverse regions, and kept the security measures like CAPTCHA or two-factor authentication.
Assumptions: Added that the restaurant must be registered on the platform, which is a necessary condition for the owner to have login credentials.
Note: Added a suggestion for a password recovery option, which is practical for restaurant owners who might forget their credentials during busy operations.
Let me know if you'd like to adjust this further or add more details! If you need additional information to refine this use case (e.g., specific platform features), I can search for more context if needed.

Note:

The system should offer a "Forgot Password" option to assist customers in recovering their accounts.

Explanation of Changes:
Actor: Changed from "Restaurant Owner" to "Customer" to reflect the new user.
Use Case Details: Updated the use case number and code to "UC-FD-030" to differentiate it within the food delivery context.
Short Definition and Conditions: Adjusted to focus on the customer logging in to browse restaurants, place orders, and track deliveries.

Pre-condition: Courier must be registered on the platform with valid credentials and have completed the initial onboarding process (e.g., background check, vehicle details).

Post-condition: Courier is successfully registered with one or more restaurants and can receive delivery assignments from them.

Priority: High

Frequency of Occurrence: Low, typically a one-time action unless the courier wants to add more restaurants.

Main Path:

Courier logs into the courier dashboard or app.
Courier navigates to the "Restaurant Registration" section.
Courier selects restaurants to register with (e.g., based on location, cuisine type).
Courier submits the registration request, including any required details (e.g., availability, delivery range).
System forwards the request to the restaurant for approval.
Once approved, the system updates the courier’s profile to reflect the new restaurant partnerships.
Alternative Path:

A.01: If the restaurant rejects the registration, the system notifies the courier with the reason (e.g., too many couriers already).

A.02: If the courier’s profile is incomplete (e.g., missing vehicle details), the system prompts the courier to provide the required information before proceeding.

Containing Use-Case(s):
Special Requirements:

The system must allow couriers to filter restaurants by location or proximity.
The platform should notify couriers of registration status updates in real-time.
Assumptions:

Courier has an internet connection and access to the platform.
Restaurants are active on the platform and accepting new courier registrations.

If rejected, the system returns the request to the pool for another courier to accept.
Alternative Path:

A.01: If the courier does not respond within a set time (e.g., 30 seconds), the system automatically rejects the request and assigns it to another courier.

A.02: If the courier rejects too many requests consecutively, the system may temporarily lower their priority for new requests.

Containing Use-Case(s):
Special Requirements:

The system must display key details (e.g., distance, estimated time, earnings) in the request notification.
The platform should allow couriers to set preferences for accepting requests (e.g., maximum distance).

Courier tracks earnings, completed deliveries, and ratings. what can be a shorter and a more definitive name for this use case




The current use case name, "Courier Tracks Earnings and Performance," is descriptive but can be made shorter and more definitive while retaining clarity. Here are a couple of suggestions:

Shorter and More Definitive Name Options:
"Courier Monitors Performance"
This name is concise and captures the essence of tracking earnings, completed deliveries, and ratings under the umbrella of "performance." It avoids listing all elements explicitly while still being clear.
"Courier Views Stats"
This is even shorter and uses "Stats" as a common shorthand for earnings, deliveries, and ratings. It’s definitive in focusing on the action (viewing) and the subject (statistics/performance data).
Recommendation:
I recommend "Courier Monitors Performance" as it strikes a balance between brevity and clarity, ensuring the purpose of the use case is immediately understood without being overly wordy.

Updated Use Case Table with New Name:
Here’s the revised use case table with the new name "Courier Monitors Performance":

Restaurant Owner and Courier Registration: Both require admin approval due to the need for verification of business details (for restaurants) or background checks (for couriers). They also involve uploading documents, which isn’t required for customers.
Customer Registration: This process is simpler and faster, as it doesn’t require admin approval, but includes a verification step (email/SMS) to ensure account security. Social media login options are also emphasized for customers to enhance user experience.
