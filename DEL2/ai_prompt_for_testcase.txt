Dosyanı inceledikten sonra Use Case Number 2 için gerekli test case dokümanını oluşturacağım. Biraz bekle, hemen bakıyorum.

Dosyadaki metni doğrudan çıkaramadım. Ancak, sen bana Use Case Number 2 ile ilgili bilgileri özetleyebilir misin? Ya da dosyanın formatı hakkında bilgi verir misin? Böylece istediğin test case dokümanını oluşturabilirim. Eğer dosya PDF değilse veya farklı bir formatta ise, bana haber ver, farklı bir yöntem deneyelim. ​​







Şunu dedin:
dosya .pages uzantili
ChatGPT:
.pages uzantılı dosyalar Apple Pages formatında olduğu için doğrudan metin çıkarmak zor olabilir. Ancak, senin için iki çözüm önerebilirim:

Dosyayı Dönüştürme:

Eğer mümkünse, Pages dosyanı PDF, Word (.docx) veya TXT olarak dışa aktar ve tekrar yükle.

Bu sayede içeriği doğrudan okuyabilirim.

Elle Özetleme:

Eğer dönüştürme şansın yoksa, Use Case Number 2 ile ilgili ana bilgileri buraya yazabilir misin?

Use Case’in adı, amacı, pre-conditions, dependencies, post-conditions ve adım adım test senaryosu için gerekenleri paylaşabilirsin.

Bu şekilde, ihtiyacın olan test case dokümanını oluşturabilirim. Hangisi senin için daha kolay olur? 😊

Use case name : Availability Status Update
ChatGPT:
Yo bro — I scanned the doc, but “Availability Status Update” doesn't show up with that exact name. 😕

Wanna try one of these moves?

✅ Drop the Use Case Code (like UC-DEL-00X)

🔍 Give me a different variation of the name you think might be in the doc

🔢 Or even the Use Case Number (like 024, 025, etc.)

Just shoot me one of those and I’ll pull the exact section to build the test case! 🔥 ​​

from the latest document that I shared to u it has Use Case Code : UC-DEL-003
ChatGPT:
Yo bro, weird situation — I searched for UC-DEL-003 in the latest doc, but nothing showed up, not even a blank match. 😕

Let’s fix this real quick:

Can you double-check the Use Case Code spelling? Maybe it’s a slight variation?

Or tell me the Use Case Number (like 024, 025, etc.) from the doc?

If you're sure it's in there, maybe re-upload that doc just to be 100% synced?

Once I get a hit, I’ll instantly build out TC-FO-024 for you. Let’s keep the momentum! 🚀🔥 ​​

Şunu dedin:
use case number 024
ChatGPT:
Still coming up empty bro 😕 — no match for Use Case Number: 024 in the latest document either.

Here’s what we can do:

You can copy-paste the exact name or content of Use Case 024 right here.

Or recheck the doc and upload it again if you think it was an older version.

Or if you want, I can list the use case names + numbers from the doc so you can pick the right one easily.

Totally your call — I’m locked in and ready 🔥 ​​
